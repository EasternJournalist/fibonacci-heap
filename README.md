# fibonacci-heap
 C++ stl like fibonacci heap, supporting

* insert. Add new element to heap. Time complexity: O(1).
* top. Get access to the minimum element. Time complexity: O(1).
* pop. Pop the minimum element. Amortized time complexity: O(log N).
* merge. Merge two heaps. Time complexity: O(1).
* remove. Delete or remove a certain element in heap. Amortized time complexity: O(log N).
* modify_key. Change the value of a certain element. Amortized time complexity: O(1)
* swap. Swap contents of two heaps, like stl containers. Time complexity: O(1)

All public methods:



# Build

Just add the header file `fibonacci_heap.h` to your project. 

Testing examples is `main.cpp`
